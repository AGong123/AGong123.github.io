  <h1>My Game</h1>

  <!-- New Header -->
  <h2>For our final project for this semesters iOS app development class, we have to make our very own app using Xcode.</h2>

  <!-- Code Video -->
  <div class="media">

      <source src="Photo & Audio/BadGame.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <ul>
      <li>In Week 1 I originally planned to use edited photos I had compiled of roads and wilderness backgrounds, along with images of cars and other objects from the internet, to set the stage for the game.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="media">
    <video id="SimpleGameVideo2" controls>
      <source src="Photo & Audio/SimpleGameVideo2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <ul>
      <li>As Week 2 started I noticed the edited photos didnâ€™t work well, so I decided to try again with a new app. In this version, I coded rectangles to slide down the screen, creating a dashed centerline and two solid outer lines to form a road. I also added a car to drive on it.</li>
      <li>Later In Week 2 when the shapes were in place, I created a movement function for the car. It can now move side to side across the screen without crossing the solid outer lines. Additionally, the car rotates slightly when it moves left or right, adding a touch of realism. </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="media">
    <video id="SimpleGameVideo2" controls>
      <source src="Photo & Audio/SGWeek3Video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <ul>
      <li>Now that the car moves fluidly and even turns slightly with the movement, I added falling objects that get in the car's way. If you, as the player, drive the car into an object, the game ends, and your score stops counting.</li>
      <li>I am still working on stopping the road entirely at the end of the game and making the score update smoothly, without flashing during or after the game.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="media">
    <video id="FinalSimpleGameVideo" controls>
      <source src="Photo & Audio/FinalSGVideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <ul>
      <li>In this final update to my game, I addressed all issues and implemented improvements based on previous feedback./li>
      <li>I made the score counter smoother and less flashy during gameplay, ensuring it remains stable when displaying your final score at the end of the game.</li>
      <li>The dashed line in the road now stops between rounds, and when you reset, the road resumes at its normal playing speed.</li>
      <li>I added a "Try Again" button, allowing you to immediately start a new round without needing to exit the app.</li>
      <li>Additionally, I made minor updates to car rotation, button colors, and obstacle movement to enhance the overall aesthetics of the game.</li>
    </ul>
