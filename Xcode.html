  <h1>Login & Shop</h1>

  <!-- New Header -->
  <h2>On Xcode, I have created two working apps, both revolving around my personal interests and information. One is a login app that allows the user to access their information through a login screen. The other app is a webstore for people to purchase the things I build in woodshop.</h2>

  <!-- Code Video -->
  <div class="media">
    <video id="ShopVideo" controls>
      <source src="Photo & Audio/ShopVideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <ul>
      <li>I created an app for people to purchase my creations from my woodshop class. While it is not a real place to buy things from, it certainly could be.</li>
      <li>The app includes a main page where you select which project you would like, a page for calculating your total payment, and a checkout screen.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Game Video -->
  <div class="media">
    <video id="LoginVideo" controls>
      <source src="Photo & Audio/LoginVideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <ul>
      <li>In this new app Iâ€™ve made, the login page could be set up to show any personal information or passwords I want to have readily available, but safely guarded by a username and password.</li>
      <li>This app is less complex than the woodshop app, as it was made first. I fully customized its look and feel to my liking, similar to the woodshop app.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    // Get all video elements on the page
    const videos = document.querySelectorAll('video');

    // Add event listeners to pause other videos when one is played

      video.addEventListener('play', () => {
        videos.forEach(otherVideo => {
          if (otherVideo !== video) {
            otherVideo.pause();
          }
        });
